# My Personal Project

## **Introduction to the project**

My idea for this project is to create a text-based decision-making game that explores the impact of making the right friends with strangers who will help you the player on your adventures. As you explore further and further into the world, you will need your friends to complete certain missions. But, with more friends, comes more internal conflict with the main character of the game who realizes becoming friends with everyone is not necessarily the step in the right direction to escape this world.

### What will the application do?  

The application is a decision-making game where every decision impacts the outcome of your adventure and progress in the game! The broader way to describe this game would be a ***visual novel***.

### Who will use it?

Anyone can use the program as its main function is to serve as a game which is a source of entertainment. Anyone who is curious or bored enough, can play this game and see where their mindset and decision making takes them!

### Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me because, this genre of game has always been something I enjoyed both watching and playing growing up. As well, psychology is a huge interest of mine and coding the psychology behind friendships and how they affect you seems extremely interesting to me.

### Main Ideas Of The Game list:
- Every decision you make affects the outcome of the ending of the game!
- Understanding how and why friendships affect a person both positively and negatively!
- How to create lasting friendships that will benefit you in stages of the game.


### ***User Stories - Phase 1***
- As a user, I want to be able to add a friend to my list of friends!
- As a user, I want to be able to view my list of friends!
- As a user, I want to be able to stop being friends from someone from my list of friends!
- As a user, I want to be able to see how many times I've talked to a friend today! (have to see if this is possible)
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of friends in my list!

### ***User Stories - Phase 2***
- As a user, I want to be able to save my current FriendList! (We can fast forward the game through a method)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my FriendList! (We can fast forward the game through a method)

### ***Phase 4: Task 2***
- Fri Nov 26 11:51:39 PST 2021, Added Friend: Taiga

### ***Phase 4: Task 3***
If I had more time to work on the project, I would figure out a better way to create my panels as there is very apparent duplication among the code. This also extends to the buttons. I added the colors as a way to differentiate the two objects.
